# Summary: Fix for Preview Branches Not Showing Changes

## Issue Description

User reported that the changes from PR #35 (which fixed timestamps to show actual branch commit times in EDT timezone) were not showing up in the preview branches index.html page on GitHub Pages.

**Observed Behavior:** All preview branches showed the same timestamp instead of their individual last commit times.

## Investigation Findings

Upon investigation, I discovered that:

1. ‚úÖ The `generate-index.js` script on main branch had the correct `getLastCommitTime()` function from PR #35
2. ‚úÖ Feature branches had been synced with the updated script
3. ‚úÖ The gh-pages branch had the updated script
4. ‚ùå **BUT** the generated index.html still showed all branches with identical timestamps

**Root Cause:** The workflow's `rsync` command excludes `.git` directories when copying branch content to gh-pages. Without git history, the script fell back to using directory modification times, which were identical for all branches (they were all updated during the same workflow run).

## Solution Implemented

I implemented a metadata-based approach to preserve commit timestamps:

### Changes Made

1. **Modified `.github/workflows/preview-builder.yml`:**
   - Added a step to extract the commit timestamp before rsync
   - Stores the timestamp in a `.last-commit-time` file in each branch directory
   
   ```yaml
   # Store the last commit timestamp for this branch
   cd current
   COMMIT_TIMESTAMP=$(git log -1 --format=%ct)
   echo "$COMMIT_TIMESTAMP" > ../gh-pages/$BRANCH_NAME/.last-commit-time
   ```

2. **Updated `generate-index.js`:**
   - Modified `getLastCommitTime()` to read from `.last-commit-time` file first
   - Maintains backward compatibility with git-based and fallback approaches
   - Creates a three-tier fallback chain: metadata file ‚Üí git history ‚Üí directory mtime

3. **Added Documentation:**
   - Created `TIMESTAMP_FIX.md` with detailed technical explanation
   - Updated `README.md` with information about how timestamps work

### How It Works Now

```
When a branch is pushed:
1. GitHub Actions checks out the branch
2. Extracts last commit timestamp: `git log -1 --format=%ct`
3. Rsyncs files to gh-pages (excluding .git)
4. Saves timestamp to .last-commit-time file
5. generate-index.js reads timestamps from these files
6. Each branch displays its actual last commit time in EDT
```

## Testing

Tested locally with simulated branch directories and different timestamps:
```
Branch 1: Oct 1, 2025, 06:00 AM   ‚úÖ
Branch 2: Oct 10, 2025, 11:30 AM  ‚úÖ
Branch 3: Oct 15, 2025, 04:45 AM  ‚úÖ
```

All branches showed unique, accurate timestamps as expected.

## Next Steps for Deployment

To deploy this fix:

### Step 1: Merge to Main
This PR needs to be merged to the `main` branch first.

### Step 2: Propagate to All Branches
After merging to main, use the "Sync Preview Builder Workflow" to update all feature branches:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on **Actions** tab
3. Select **"Sync Preview Builder Workflow"** from the left sidebar
4. Click **"Run workflow"**
5. Keep `dry_run: false` selected
6. Click **"Run workflow"** button

This will automatically update both `preview-builder.yml` AND `generate-index.js` on all feature branches to match the main branch.

### Step 3: Trigger a Build
After syncing, push a change to any feature branch (or re-run an existing workflow) to generate the index with corrected timestamps.

## Expected Results

Once deployed and a branch is pushed:

‚úÖ Each branch will show its actual last commit timestamp  
‚úÖ Timestamps will be displayed in EDT/EST timezone  
‚úÖ Format will be readable: "Oct 15, 2025, 05:45 AM"  
‚úÖ No more identical timestamps across all branches  
‚úÖ Easy to see which previews are fresh vs outdated  

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/preview-builder.yml` - Added timestamp extraction
- `generate-index.js` - Added metadata file reading
- `README.md` - Added timestamp documentation
- `TIMESTAMP_FIX.md` - Technical documentation (new)
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This file (new)

## Benefits

- üéØ **Accurate Information:** Shows real commit times, not generation times
- üîß **Simple Implementation:** Just one metadata file per branch
- üõ°Ô∏è **Backward Compatible:** Maintains fallback chain for edge cases
- üìä **Easy Debugging:** Metadata files are plain text and easy to inspect
- ‚ö° **Minimal Performance Impact:** Simple file read operation
- üîÑ **Automatic:** Works seamlessly with existing workflow structure

## Validation Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] All branches show different timestamps (if they have different commit times)
- [ ] Timestamps are in EDT/EST timezone
- [ ] Format is "MMM DD, YYYY, HH:MM AM/PM"
- [ ] Pushing to a branch updates its timestamp
- [ ] Old branches show their historical commit times, not today's date

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Review `TIMESTAMP_FIX.md` for technical details
2. Check `README.md` for usage information
3. Run `./verify-preview-builder.sh` to check branch sync status
4. Review GitHub Actions logs for workflow execution details
